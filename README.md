Diamond Buildings  
==================  
A lightweight **Fabric** add-on for **Minecraft 1.20.1** that simply lets you build with diamond, gold and iron—literally.  
Turn your surplus gems and ingots into full building palettes: stairs, slabs, buttons, pressure plates, fences, fence gates, walls, doors and trapdoors.
